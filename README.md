# Hyper Hacking
## Am editor theme by Anderycks

This is a theme that I, Deryck Hodge, use. I first
created a terminal theme matching this colorscheme when I was
using Hyper terminal. That's why I call this the Hyper Hacking
theme.

I no longer use Hyper terminal, but the color scheme lives on in
my terminal setups and editor themes. So I created this extension
to use my own personal theme within Nova now.

### Notes on usage

I really only use this for the editor theme and use other themes
for the window theme. The window theme included here is just the
default when you select "Create new extension..." within Nova.

I personally use Hyper Hacking with Night Owls Black, but YMMV.
